# Timer
An 8-bit Timer is a type of timing counter circuit in digital systems, designed to measure time or generate periodic events. The term “8-bit” refers to the counter’s capacity, allowing it to store values from 0 to 255.

It is used to measure time intervals between events in a system. Based on a clock signal, the counter increments or decrements its value over a defined period of time.

The timer can generate output clock signals with a specified frequency, which are used in applications such as peripheral device control.

It is also used to manage overflow and underflow events.

  . Overflow occurs when the counter value increases from the maximum value (255) back to 0.

  . Underflow occurs when the counter value decreases from 0 down to the maximum value (255).
